1,"mike tyson could have been sick or tired, since his training was harsh. bro went harder on training instead of the fight",0
2,who's making fun of tyson,0
3,people are making fun of him? no i'm pretty sure people are making fun of jake paul for fighting the elderli,0
4,"debuff
old age
retired from boxing probably lost skills

5,"8 rounds with about 30 years age difference?? the dude is a legend, how can anyone say he's not great",0
6,again jake paul fighting an old mike tyson doesn’t seem right. let the guy rest. mike tyson did want the fight as sort of something to do,0
7,the worlds peoples champion words or less to describe the legendary mike tyson,0
8,this is scripted mike does it for money he has 7loses now,0
9,"i already know imma get hate but tyson did not fight eight rounds. he fought two,maybe three,rounds and was gass",0
10,no one would talk to mike tyson like this if he was in his prime💀 and if you do goodluck getting pound,0
11,he's almost 60. it could have been worse. jake is a way younger guy and did have some training. only a moron would believe that mike could really win a match with jake.,0
12,whomever dares make fun of mike tyson is a giant scumbag,0
13,mike tyson wanted money thats why he made himself los,0

20,nah he lost 😂,0
21,next jake paul fight will be with a 100yrs old buddha.,0
22,i seen and read the script it all makes sens,0
23,i have nothing but respect for mike and the way he conducted himself during that fight at the age he’s at. i think if he’s even just 10 years younger it’s a better fight in tysons favor. i still enjoyed the entire live show.,0
24,of f off. this was all staged.,0
25,bro you don't no it was script,0
26,that's nice but he still lost,0
27,it's participation that counts. life is not all about win,0
28,"jake paul ain't that bad he slips up bad every now n then but we all human so meh i'm just happy i got to see him step into a ring n fight as young as i am i was not around at that time lol and i kinda grown up on the paul family lol as part of the new generation of the world, i'm good with it",0

40,either you lose to a 58 year old man or beat up a 58 year old man.,0
41,knowing that ppl sure respect that 👏,0
42,"because the f
fight was script",0
43,a 58 year old man going 8 rounds against a man 30 years his younger is the winner in my books not the bum who refuses to fight real fight,0
44,look of the hits from a old man too a younger white boys jaw,0
45,"hes also 31 years older than jake, just to put that out ther",0
46,"i think the fight was just to help both fighters make easy cash, it was a sham, just like the 2020 elect",0

mike did a really nice job.",0
59,mike ain in his prime tho,0

71,tyson of my childhood would've literally ate paul... 👂,0
72,it was scripted bruh,0
73,i have huge respect for tyson getting in there at that age.  he did it for his family and to reminisce. he knew it was staged and he would lose. but he did it anyway because he’s a real man who will do anything for his family. if you can’t respect him for that then your morals are just plain wrong,0

75,"u.s. senate candidates: we need action two u.s. senate candidates and two state representative candidates shared similar views. “it’s actually astounding and infuriating that these types of egregious human rights problems are going on in china, and that we are aware of it in our country, and that we are not addressing the issues,” said independent senate nominee and former state senator dr. mike katz. “but we fail because of the influence of money. it’s very concerning, and we need strong leadership in this country to step forward and to deal with it immediately.”   independent senate nominee and former state senator dr. mike katz  senator katz emphasized how the film revealed the true nature of communism and its harm on humanity. “it’s been a slow infiltration of communism mindset in this country. it’s occurring in our academic institutions. it’s the influence of money coming in from overseas that is teaching our students not how to critically think, but what to think. and that is very concerning about the future of our country, but it’s been going on for several years,” he said.  senator katz said he has always been aware that there were human rights problems in china, and he called on people to become aware of the issues and not just stand by.  u.s. senate candidate eric hansen said he was shocked when he heard about the forced organ harvesting in china which is supported by the ccp. “it’s just such a tragedy, and the fact that the world doesn’t know about this, the fact that you’re drawing attention to it, is very important,” he said.   u.s. senate candidate eric hansen (right), with falun gong practitioner cheng peiming  mr. hansen said the abhorrent crime of organ harvesting must be ended. “get the word out, please, because it’s such a huge issue that’s being unaddressed,” he stated.",0

81,"mike tyson is the boxing monument of the world. it seems unlikely that anyone will be able to do it in a few centuries... i grew up at the same time as mike, so i feel proud at this age to still be able to compete with a top-class boxer. winning the weight is truly a miracle. although there is a script, winning over yourself is the greatest victory.",0

top golf has this down. it has an open and long field with fences meant for beginners and even pro level golfers. there’s no need to show off that you can hit 300 yards when the majority of actual courses are between 100-250 yards per hole with maybe a couple over 300, but at that point go to an actual outdoor range.

you aren’t going to be accurate hitting over 200 yards unless you’re a pro. these ranges are meant for people to get accurate at hitting rather than do a happy gilmore every shot.

672,"ngl, mike was only there for the money, like in his training he wasn't a npc and had good stamina, and clearly jake paul himself was holding back, this match was already staged during the contract, like it doesn't matter whether he's 58 or not, he wouldn't have signed up for the fight if he didnt have it in him, but later changed his mind because 20 mil is 20 mil, if only he had thrown some hard punches each round, the official judges might've favored him if unofficial didnt",0

806,the rangers made an adrian beltre bobblehead from that moment. it's awesome!,0
807,the ump got into ichiro's personal space and should have been fired.,0
808,umpires are assholes who wish they were as great as the players. this is the only way they can affect the outcome of the game.,0
809,umpires are garbag,0
810,the ump was more upset about being called out than ichiro was about being struck out,0
811,"of course ichiro was right the man was the best hitter in baseball history, had the vision of a fucking hawk.",0

829,"i can't count the number of times i wanted to do this even in the minors, but i did it in college once, but never did it again (out of respect to the ump and for my next plate appearance). the reason was because i learned in high school to watch every pitch into the catcher's glove after seeing pete rose do it so many times. (i hit .424 in college, 2nd round pick)",0
830,"playing softball, many years ago, we had an ump that litterally nobody liked, as he was the most arrogant and incompetent sob ever known to the sport... he made a shitty call on me, and as soon as i pointed it out, he ejected me without batting an eye, as he always did to others, until the other teams' catcher got up, and yelled for everyone to hear : ""he is right, that was a ball for 6 inches outside, dipshit !!""   the laughter from the crowd is unforgettable, and the look on his face for being exposed as the fool he was, was priceless...
funny that it was the last game we saw him...
i never got to thank that catcher, though...",0

836,looks like mlb has bad umpires. maybe get some new ones.,0
837,when umpires think they’re the stars…,0
838,2 balls off the plate is a strike.,0
839,league needs to issue an ultimatum to these temperamental babies. sucks that the umps have a union supporting them cuz they can essentially get away with acting like total children while officiating a fucking pro game. it’s insane. it is the definition of letting your ego take over. they get free rein to make bad calls and punish those who object to it? it’s totally backwards and i’ve never seen anything like it. in hockey players will have full on debates with the refs and get nothing more than a talking to. that’s how it should be.,0
840,"these umpires have been given the right to throw out players that are cool, calm and collected, just because they felt like it. even tho nothing may have been said. they shouldn't be there to judge calls if they can't take kind words in return of bad calls they do.",0

900,qbs need to earn their pay,0
901,it’s because having an alright quarterback is still extremely important to an organization. it’s the most important centerpiece in an office.,0
902,"we are reaching a point where the statistical advantage is questioning the quarterback pay. we're gonna see a ""running backs don't matter"" convo about qbs in 5-7 year",0
903,danny dimes is the peak of this.,0
904,"corner is certainly the hardest position. the wr knew where he was going, i didn’t. and i had to stop him from making the catch.",0
905,if he’s right then a smart gm will be successful with his strategy.,0
906,"should be a pay scale for qbs that groups them based on performance, accomplishments etc. so only top top guys (sb champs, mvps, multiple pro bowls or all-pros) get the top top money",0
907,qb ain’t even the hardest position on the field and they get 3x more pay then elite cornerback,0
908,imagine if every team only had one receiver. money would be different. just because average qbs exist doesnt mean they still arent half the entire offense.,0
909,what yall showing j love for  and look at last year his numbers was worse and he still finished top 3 in touchdowns   top 7 in yards and top 10 in qbr,0
910,no lies were told. start paying your offensive line. half of your line is out there wearing a knee brace and playing injur,0
911,"because trevor has the all americana look.
pretty much hes white and looks the part.",0
912,and lawrence is taking all the blame in the media for the jaguars failur,0
913,all i know is my qb is worth every penny go bolts ⚡,0
914,there is no middle tier for qb contracts. he's spot on,0
915,"i think it’s cuz you only have 2, 3 at most, spots on your roster for qbs, so they really all gotta be playable.",0
916,understanding your point. but most positions like wr and rb are a dime a dozen. u can draft those positions every year. qb sre much harder to find. most teams pay a qb like trevor bc they dont want to lose him to a different team. wr and rb hit in the draft multiple times a year,0
917,"this is not a football issue, it is an economics issue.",0
918,dak prescott doing dak prescott things 😂,0
919,"it shouldn’t be too hard to understand, the qb touches the ball every play. you’re paying your team decision maker there’s a reason rbs for example are disposable in comparison to qb",0
920,"it's harder to find a qb than other positions, that's whi",0
921,because pro level qbs don’t grow on trees.  the demand is so high and the pool so shallow even the bad ones get jobs.  and get the money they ask or the team literally has to draft someone from another position to do the job. or even some rando off the street.   guess what?  that guy’s gonna want top dollar even if he sucks but can still pretend he’s capable of,0
922,the way the nfl was built to win super bowls back then isn't the way it's built now to win super bowls.,0
923,you can thank the browns and deshaun watson for destroying the market after that the rest is histori,0
924,he’s right to rectify this the whole nfl salary cap and contract landscape has to shift which would most likely involve lots of lawyers and agents. it’s an uphill battle before anything changes.,0
925,no way daniel jones getting paid more than the janitor,0
926,"i think it’s a reach thing.  if you’re a head coach or gm taking over a shitty team, the one thing you’re desperate to do asap is to tell your owner, “sir, we’ve found our quarterback!”
once you’ve done that, you’ve guaranteed yourself some job security.  because the owner will then write the huge check to the qb, and he will often then want to give said coach & gm as much time as possible to build a team around that qb.  this is why once daniel jones showed even a little bit of success, the coach and gm went to ownership and insisted that jones was the answer for the giants.",1
927,🫤.....one of the few times it's not crazy work what he say,0
928,"because running back is a useless position for the most part, your team isn’t great because you have a great running back",0
929,he no one real good jalen hurts trash ass,0
930,it’s cause an nfl team lives or dies based on their quarterback very few except,0
931,it’s why i don’t even like the nfl except for watching some red zone i can’t watch single games anymore it’s awful red zone makes you forget how bad it’s gotten,0
932,it’s literally about supply and demand but hey you do you.,0

938,an average qb is more important than an elite receiver or rb,0
939,exactly yo. tlaw hasn't done anything in the nfl to deserve that money.,0
940,wr’s are at times divas and eventually become a problem in the locker room. and rb’s are not 100% reliable as they don’t have long careers like qb’s. yes it’s unfair that an average qb like trevor lawerence is getting payed a ridiculous amount of money with no good results. but most teams would rather pay an average qb a lot of money than a rb that would loose steam by year 5,0
941,"wanna know what i want to know more? 
how!? can dudes go all the way through collage and not learn supply & demand. 
it used to be ""its racistt"" now its...how come the rarest ""just good"" position player gets the most....smh...
there are 1000s of just good running backs
there are 32 ""just good"" qbs.",0
942,"keep in mind that these gm’s have to listen to and keep the owners happy, but 100%",0
943,because it’s still harder to be an average qb in the nfl than being elite at any other position.,0
944,i've been saying this since the daniel jones contract.,0
945,they get paid the most because teams are nothing without a quarterback.,0
946,i can’t even imagine the contract carson palmer would get in todays gam,0
947,yea nah the qb pay is inflated af. no issues with elite qbs getting their money but when barely above average qbs get paid that ain’t right,0
948,qb the most important role. that's why.,0
949,"been saying this , it literally don’t make financial sens",0
950,how do you even guess it?!?!,0
951,diddy are u the reason his gone???,0
952,boy knows his craft! wow!,0
953,kobe was consistently missing shot every game. so its norm,0
954,just so yall know kobe has the most missed shots in nba history or at least until few weeks ago when bron broke it and a quarter inch isn't enough to really be missing a significant difference in shots so i think kobe was missing and said something and got lucky with it but i'm sure half the normal nba rims players play on or practice on aren't exactly 10 ft,0
955,i understand it now ahhh,0
956,"to small but they fixed the height
astrophys",0
957,damn.. that’s skill.,0
958,and low ball players saying its not with the ring or the ball.,0
959,space jam if the aliens didn't exist:,0
960,dude paid his victim off,0
961,the rim was a quarter inch to small so they fixed the height. also its good to know how much a quarter inch cost,0
962,if only he was that good at flying helicopters. lol😅,0
963,my and kobe have the same birthday august 23,0
964,"thats why he miss 14481 shot,  no.1 in nba histori",0
965,buddy said i understand now r.i.p,0
966,similar to when ayrton senna knew just by hearing the sound of the other cars that something was off.  it turns out that the other cars were running traction control.,0
967,"miss green, your test is wrong.",0
968,kobe is the most overrated player of all time!,0
969,no way this is true.,0
970,"he is a really smart guy , he knew that he wasn’t wrong but the rim was , respect to kobe❤️",0
971,"friends, this is what greatness looks lik",0
972,kobe is so good he knows when he doesn't miss,0
973,that’s exactly why i miss all my shot,0
974,i don’t buy this.,0
975,they killed him because he started to speak publicly against pharmaceutical compani,0
976,the same thing happened to steph when he was dribbling and lost the ball and went to the officials and told them the floor was off,0
977,i understand it now,0
978,it's like when curry discovered the floor tile during warm-up.,0
979,videos from different times.,0
980,stephen curry was dribbling but he missed and he said this part is not wood and the ball can't bounc,0
981,actually quite a few basketball players could pick win the rim was off larry bird once said the rim was off by 2° and when they put a level on it he was correct,0
982,and thats why he will never be the goat because he rely to much on his muscle memorri,0
983,this is why you dont use ai to edit. you asked for a quarter of an inch. ai gave you a fucking inch of quarters.,0
984,after asking for towel he hard r the girl in denv,0
985,kobe and curry both have some good sens,0
986,"he also pinpointed a deadspot in a court, pretty cool",0
987,barely hits the rim and he thinks it's the rim lol,0
988,he blames the rim and was right,0
989,"this is similar to that company who made high end chairs and had their motto be something like “if you bought our chair and it wobbles, fix your flooring”",0
990,"""you guys, what do you mean it's fine??  it's kobe, and he's missing, we need thre to be a problem with the hoop.  look nobody is going to be upset, just say it's 1/4"" too small and we'll change some things, tighten some bolts and whatnot.  we can't tell kobe he is wrong....""",0
991,typical celt,0
992,if it's not me it's you was a person,0
993,kobe is on fire .......as his flight goes down in flam,0
994,you know your one of the goats when you notice the rim is off,0
995,we love the legend kobe sadly he di,0
996,what a legend,0
997,"imagine knowing it was 1/4"" off and instead of moving your shot to account for it you made them replace the rim 😅😂",0
998,"that was shown well on a german comedy show with dirk nowitzki as the guest. they were about to shoot hoops and the host lowered the entire rim by a few inches.

nowitzki barely hit any of his shots. the host even jokingly asked ""the pay you for that?""",0
999,doubt thi,0
