300,n_V5DvMgSlg,Matt Carpenter was confused for a second 😅,"The home to 1st base is automatically out when the pitcher steps on the base.
The 1st to 2nd runner is out the moment both him and his teammates touch the base at the same time. If not there would be no Double play plays . Right ?"
301,n_V5DvMgSlg,Matt Carpenter was confused for a second 😅,Or not.
302,n_V5DvMgSlg,Matt Carpenter was confused for a second 😅,This should be in every baserunning tutorial.  Fck the force.
303,n_V5DvMgSlg,Matt Carpenter was confused for a second 😅,"He hesitated, he sould of thrown to 2nd an to try to get the DP"
304,n_V5DvMgSlg,Matt Carpenter was confused for a second 😅,"He tagged the bag first, which means the runner can stay or go"
305,n_V5DvMgSlg,Matt Carpenter was confused for a second 😅,"No, the 1st basemen played it poorly. All he had to do was tag the runner BEFORE stepping on the base and it's a double play."
306,n_V5DvMgSlg,Matt Carpenter was confused for a second 😅,All he had to do was tag him then step on first base...
307,n_V5DvMgSlg,Matt Carpenter was confused for a second 😅,If javy Baez could just run the bases and not have to hit he'd actually be worth that contract
308,n_V5DvMgSlg,Matt Carpenter was confused for a second 😅,"All he had to do was tag the guy who was standing on first base and then that guy is forced out. Then he had to put his foot on first base before the hitter got there and he has a double play.
This obviously was not a double play. The guy who hit the ball is out."
309,n_V5DvMgSlg,Matt Carpenter was confused for a second 😅,See mouth piece Brady guy talking to much
310,n_V5DvMgSlg,Matt Carpenter was confused for a second 😅,If he would have thrown to second base first this wouldn’t have happened. Very high IQ play by the base runner!
311,n_V5DvMgSlg,Matt Carpenter was confused for a second 😅,The runner just got lucky that the fielder wasn't paying attention.
312,n_V5DvMgSlg,Matt Carpenter was confused for a second 😅,Hehe .  So witty...😅
313,n_V5DvMgSlg,Matt Carpenter was confused for a second 😅,They both suppose to be out
314,n_V5DvMgSlg,Matt Carpenter was confused for a second 😅,"I get how odd this appears, but if you boil it down, they lost the double play the second the runner got the fielder to bite and delay his throw to second. At that point, it was just a  matter of picking which guy to get out.

It's a smart play, but one that will cause the game to further devolve as an entertaining franchise if everyone decided to start doing it. (and enough fielders bit)"
315,n_V5DvMgSlg,Matt Carpenter was confused for a second 😅,Shouldn't he have tagged the runner then stepped on first base?
316,n_V5DvMgSlg,Matt Carpenter was confused for a second 😅,Shouldn’t have touched the bag.
317,n_V5DvMgSlg,Matt Carpenter was confused for a second 😅,"I feel teased or COMPELLED to state that this video iconicizes, which it sort of kind of does, what happens when a country steals anothers hard work

Viz a vis Cricket and Baseball

The American Apple Pie"
318,n_V5DvMgSlg,Matt Carpenter was confused for a second 😅,"I understand that once the batter/runner is out it's no longer a force at 2nd for the guy standing on 1st. I also understand that all Carpenter had to do is tag the runner and then touch 1st for the double play. The part I'm confused about and maybe someone could help me understand is, the batter/runner isn't out until Carpenter touches 1st. So it's still a force at 2nd until that time, but since the runner was back to 1st before Carpenter was, wouldn't that make two people on 1st since the batter/runner isn't out until Carpenters foot touches 1st? Obviously the correct call was made, I've seen similar plays but the 1st baseman touched before the runner."
319,n_V5DvMgSlg,Matt Carpenter was confused for a second 😅,Tag the runner and then step on bag?
320,n_V5DvMgSlg,Matt Carpenter was confused for a second 😅,If he had tagged the 1st runner before stepping on bag double play?
321,n_V5DvMgSlg,Matt Carpenter was confused for a second 😅,"Either you can hit home runs or steal bases… if you can’t do either, why are you in the NBL?"
322,n_V5DvMgSlg,Matt Carpenter was confused for a second 😅,"I guess because he tagged the bag before batter got there, that made runner legally safe on first?"
323,n_V5DvMgSlg,Matt Carpenter was confused for a second 😅,How can you make rounders so complicated? 🤔
324,n_V5DvMgSlg,Matt Carpenter was confused for a second 😅,"A question to make you think: ive been watching both baseball and football for 20+ years now. Is the fact that baseball consistently provides more ""wtf pass me a rule book"" moments because baseball rules are weirder or because baseball plays 11 trillion games a season, giving more chances for weird stuff to happen?"

525,ZuC8jb-X_uA,Silent Hill 2 Remake - ENDING,I understand Angela because I have been threw that not with my father but with my maternal grandfather he was a horrible drunk and just not a good person in general he made me feel like it was my fault for so long so yeah I understand I get it thats why I still cry every single time I watch Angela...😢😢😢😢 but when I watch jack he makes me laugh hard like belly laugh and then I watch his girlfriend play and she is also playing and i watched a funny comment she made about one of the straight jackets like dude have you smelled floor lol...hilarious.
526,ZuC8jb-X_uA,Silent Hill 2 Remake - ENDING,Ngl Hella suprized jack hasnt played black myth yet😊
527,ZuC8jb-X_uA,Silent Hill 2 Remake - ENDING,16:35 why do I get the hint that Angela is bipolar she goes from crying one second to serious the next
528,ZuC8jb-X_uA,Silent Hill 2 Remake - ENDING,"Thank you for the gameplay! I watched it all, and cried at the end. Even though i knew the story already. The actors' performances made this whole game even more heartbreaking. 😢
Also, i think Mary might have had leukemia. Children can have that too, but they have better chances at surviving, hence  why Laura is healthy. Also the patients do vomit, as i heard blood.
It is a terrible disease.😭"
529,ZuC8jb-X_uA,Silent Hill 2 Remake - ENDING,"the triangle boss are the representation of how cruel James was when he k*lled Mary
the nurse are the representation of James lust when he want to do the ""thing"" when Mary is sick"
530,ZuC8jb-X_uA,Silent Hill 2 Remake - ENDING,It’s 4am where I’m at and I work in the morning but I just HAD to finish this. Ugh I love it so much and it hits a personal spot. So so sad but oddly peaceful
531,ZuC8jb-X_uA,Silent Hill 2 Remake - ENDING,The jacket was made by the time lords 😂
532,ZuC8jb-X_uA,Silent Hill 2 Remake - ENDING,"As someone with a terminal illness, this game tears me up inside because I've thought and felt so many of these things in the last few years. Thank you for playing this, Jack. I needed a good cry. It's too easy to be so numb it's like not existing anymore, but I'm still kicking. Much love and appreciation for the years of entertainment. You made me feel less lonely all the time. You're an angel, Sean. A little Irish angel. Lol. ❤🌺"
533,ZuC8jb-X_uA,Silent Hill 2 Remake - ENDING,This playthrough truly wrecked me because I never played or watched Silent Hill.
534,ZuC8jb-X_uA,Silent Hill 2 Remake - ENDING,"My favourite reoccurring joke this series is the save screen monologues. How Sean goes from super serious topic to some weird comment about ""Leaving the oven on"""
535,ZuC8jb-X_uA,Silent Hill 2 Remake - ENDING,I would love to see you play mgs4
536,ZuC8jb-X_uA,Silent Hill 2 Remake - ENDING,Hopefully theres a patch for the frame rates.
537,ZuC8jb-X_uA,Silent Hill 2 Remake - ENDING,You know what? We need a compilation of save stations monologues 😂😂😂
538,ZuC8jb-X_uA,Silent Hill 2 Remake - ENDING,Hey Sean! There's a great video you can watch about Silent Hill 2 that will give you a deeper conceptual understanding into the game. The video is called Silent Hill 2 Theory | A Dream of Death Between Heaven and Hell. I thoroughly enjoyed watching you play :)
539,ZuC8jb-X_uA,Silent Hill 2 Remake - ENDING,"Uwu noo your poor poor toe, how dare! Get well soon Sean I'm sending hearts and teddy bears for ultimate recovery!"
540,ZuC8jb-X_uA,Silent Hill 2 Remake - ENDING,1:56:24 Im gonna get him hes never gonna expect this... SNE- *blam* BARG!
541,ZuC8jb-X_uA,Silent Hill 2 Remake - ENDING,"I'm still a little upset that you couldn't use the sword like in the original, still, you did get to hold it."
542,ZuC8jb-X_uA,Silent Hill 2 Remake - ENDING,1:00:13 Jack missed pyramid head watching him through the fence
543,ZuC8jb-X_uA,Silent Hill 2 Remake - ENDING,"At the end of the day, James is just a really broken man. He's so overwhelmed with grief that he couldn't fathom staying with his wife anymore, and that's normal. He couldn't handle the pain, he couldn't bear seeing her, thinking of all the things he thought of while she was sick. It's a cocktail of shame and regret and not wanting to feel that brought James to Silent Hill. He didn't want to feel what he felt before, he knew it wasn't right, and that's what Silent Hill took to torment him. It knows that he's weak, helpless, so lost in his own guilt and shame that just a bit more push would drive him insane."
544,ZuC8jb-X_uA,Silent Hill 2 Remake - ENDING,"I hate that When Jack talked about being in the Thick of it, i immediatly thought of ksi’s new song"
545,ZuC8jb-X_uA,Silent Hill 2 Remake - ENDING,"I find it kinda funny how James did not even question what the hell is going on, not even once. Like everything was supposed to be, like it was normal, it just like that. Any normal person would immediately knows something is not right when you meet the girl that was stabbed a few hours ago, all kickin, alive and well. And here James just being James and did not call the bullshit at all. Another example is him casually sticking his hand in the wall hole and jump into the abyss without trying to find another solution. It's like he simultaneously know and doesn't know about Silent Hill. Maybe the whole looping thing is right. It's like you replaying Skyrim again and force your own brain to forget certain things so you can have that first time feeling again."
546,ZuC8jb-X_uA,Silent Hill 2 Remake - ENDING,Walter Sullivan is the main antagonist of Silent Hill 4: The Room. He’s a serial killer who is ritualistic murdering like… 24? victims and he plans for Henry Townsend to be the final one. He also was first mentioned in Silent Hill 2 in a newspaper.
547,ZuC8jb-X_uA,Silent Hill 2 Remake - ENDING,"i love that even though you also make commentary, you “play” as whatever character you play. Even saying “ow!” when they  get hurt. I love your playthroughs bc of this!"
548,ZuC8jb-X_uA,Silent Hill 2 Remake - ENDING,"55:04 this made me laugh out loud!  Seán, I adore your puns and meme references!"

650,vzgDL5E9Ma4,Metaphor : ReFantazio,Kinda a boring video tbh didnt expect dunkey to even do a video on this game
651,vzgDL5E9Ma4,Metaphor : ReFantazio,Why was Dunkey having trouble with chicken wing? Wasn’t he *born* inside a chicken wing?
652,vzgDL5E9Ma4,Metaphor : ReFantazio,Donny Chead was my favorite actor in the movie steel guy with Bob down Jr.
653,vzgDL5E9Ma4,Metaphor : ReFantazio,Midtaphor & KSI are soulmate of playing people minds.
654,vzgDL5E9Ma4,Metaphor : ReFantazio,Are we still in more content phase ?
655,vzgDL5E9Ma4,Metaphor : ReFantazio,"Guys do NOT watch dunkey. He is adolf hitler himself. What acutally happend in ww2 is they took the painter and promised him to be safe as long as he makes a youtube channel revewing games, as well as making the fourth budokai tenkaichi game, which is the reason why the game took so long to make."
656,vzgDL5E9Ma4,Metaphor : ReFantazio,Omg voice acting can't be more generic than this!
657,vzgDL5E9Ma4,Metaphor : ReFantazio,That “whoop Dee doo lady” was so freakin funny!!
658,vzgDL5E9Ma4,Metaphor : ReFantazio,"1:39 Um... actually since they used the word ""like,"" they should have called this game ""Simile"" instead of ""Metaphor"" 😤"
659,vzgDL5E9Ma4,Metaphor : ReFantazio,"Mmmm, chicken"
660,vzgDL5E9Ma4,Metaphor : ReFantazio,0:05 album when dunkey?
661,vzgDL5E9Ma4,Metaphor : ReFantazio,is this video supposed to be funny?
662,vzgDL5E9Ma4,Metaphor : ReFantazio,Right now we are in a golden age of Dunk and in five years we will reflect on this and miss it.
663,vzgDL5E9Ma4,Metaphor : ReFantazio,3:31 goated digimon reference
664,vzgDL5E9Ma4,Metaphor : ReFantazio,blood in those animated parts but no blood in-game - pretty shitty position. I hate when devs or publishers or both try to sit on two chairs at the same time- one for kiddies and one for adults.
665,vzgDL5E9Ma4,Metaphor : ReFantazio,These anime games are sadly blending into one generic looking game
666,vzgDL5E9Ma4,Metaphor : ReFantazio,"Damn, Dunkey, you're really desperate to buy that Nintendo Switch 2 Pro, you'll play anything for views."
667,vzgDL5E9Ma4,Metaphor : ReFantazio,i will die before i play a game like this
668,vzgDL5E9Ma4,Metaphor : ReFantazio,Dunkey is preparing for his kids college funds
669,vzgDL5E9Ma4,Metaphor : ReFantazio,Really upset that when you shake the fairy's hand you don't just fully grab her
670,vzgDL5E9Ma4,Metaphor : ReFantazio,I'm really tired of these shit vids
671,vzgDL5E9Ma4,Metaphor : ReFantazio,So brave of Atlus to put out the first ever Metaphor type game.
672,vzgDL5E9Ma4,Metaphor : ReFantazio,the art style is kinda decent. and then there's that chicken guy...
673,vzgDL5E9Ma4,Metaphor : ReFantazio,"""This game really makes you feel like it's Persona.""

- IGN probably"
674,vzgDL5E9Ma4,Metaphor : ReFantazio,The whole point of this video was a metaphorical joke about Reggie at the end

You go into these houses and beware of the wildlife that travels in the waters to find people that drowned to death or died of dehydration because it was hot! Not to mention, they are still some people that are missing or the bodies were not recovered. I do not see why people take hurricanes lightly. They are no joke."

ONE TOUGH STEP AT A TIME

We're in this thing together,
Though a thousand miles away,
For the Sun that warms this heart of mine
Is the Sun that lights Your Day,
And the Winds could change direction
Its fury I could feel
It could turn my joy and laughter
To a Solemn time to Heal

I'm searching for some answers
But it seems I search in vain
For the gentle breeze that fills my day
Are the winds rhat caused  Your pain
The road ahead seems empty
And down its path I stare
Don't ask me where it leads, Aint got the answers now
But I guess I'll know in time

Got to face this journey
One Tough Step at a Time
Got to Scale each hurdle
Till the Gentle Path we find,
It really wont be easy,
Its hard to comprehend,
But there's that consolation
When You know You've Got a Friend!!

I'm searching for some answers
But it seems I search in vain
For the gentle breeze that fills my day
Are the winds rhat caused  Your pain
The road ahead seems empty
And down its path I stare
Don't ask me where it leads, Ain't got the answers now
But I guess I'll know in time .

974,Yg1WMwotiSU,Hurricane Milton: Tornado sweeps over bridge during meteorologist's live report,"Hello, I was wondering, if I can share with you the most important thing.  God the Father sent His holy Son Jesus to earth, to be born of a virgin.  He grew up and died on the cross for our sins.  Then He was put into a tomb for 3 days, after that Abba Father raised Jesus to life.He appeared to people, and went back to heaven.  We all must sincerely receive Jesus into our life to be God's child.  See John 1:12 for this please.  Will you today genuinely by faith receive Jesus into your life for salvation?"
